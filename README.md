# HI there ! 👋

I am tomasoignons. I'm a CS student at EPFL, Switzerland

## Projects

I spend most of my time doing useless things such as

* salleslibres, a mobile app and website to see the available rooms of my previous school
* A discord and instagram bot, that post every day a photo taken randomly on a the midjourney discord server (friend advice : don't try to work with the Facebook API, it is the worst API I have ever seen)
* A ML algorithm to predict the stock Market between CHF and EUR
* A uber and deliveroo clone
* An app to manage my own groceries
* A to good to go bot, that make a request to reserve your next groceries as fast as you can (semi-integrated to the previous project, to have a visual interface)
* Gurk, a chrome extension to customize the chrome web page as I want (especialy with a Google Calendar integration)
* Flambo, my next (top secret) project
* And much more

# Skills & tools 🖱️

When I need to build thing, I go between `svelte` or `react` for the front-end, and `Node.js` for the backend. For the database, I used `mongoDB` in the past, but now I do 100% of my projects with `PostgreSQL`
I have already used `next-js`, `threeJS`, `spline` or `stripe` in various projects

If the project doesn't need any kind of back-end management I will go for `node-js`. If it involves Machine Learning or tricky API, I will go for `python` and `pytorch`. If imposed, I can also work with `java`. For mobiles app, I can go with `kotlin` or `react-native` depending on my humeur

# One last thing

I love to go to the end of the project, and not abandon them during the conception, even if I see it is much more complicated that it seems at first sight (like gurk), and I don't use github every time I code, that's why my banner seems so low, but in fact I could do 3 commit / day easily with all the projects I just don't commit until the end of the project (because I am lazy, and I configure/push to a git repo only if it is really necessary -> if I go to production)
